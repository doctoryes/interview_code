Sample Poker Project
========================

This coding exercies pretends we have a work in progress poker app that we are building.

---------------

The idea is to implement the methods is_straight and is_flush in poker/hand.py so that the tests pass. Feel free to make any changes you want.
Start with is_flush and we'll move on to is_straight if time permits. Tests can be run with ``python3 -m unittest discover``
